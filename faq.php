								<p>We are a registered British and Chinese company and we are endorsed by the Chinese government, which means Chinese manufacturers take us seriously as our contracts are valid under Chinese law.</p>

								<p>If a factory is aware you are an overseas company with no physical representation in China then you will be overlooked should something go wrong.</p>

								<p>Chinese manufacturers treat us completely different and right from the start because they are more than aware that we will visit their factory in person and apply pressure should any problems arise. We will reference contractual agreements and hold them accountable for their actions</p>

						        <p>Some factories will cut corners to save on material costs to increase their own profit margins. Some will switch to cheaper materials or decrease the quantities of materials to save money. Many manufacturers are driven to cheapen the quality of a product over time.</p>

								<p>You must have in place a concrete system of quality control if you are importing from China. If you fail to do so then the outcomes can be disastrous, and in many cases financially ruin businesses.</p>

								<p>AGSS offers a rigorous quality control plan. We have specially trained staff who can be on a factory floor within 24 hours. We guarantee to detect any quality issues before your order is shipped.</p>

								<p>The best way to establish quality standards is to have a sample created from the factory. A sales contract will state that the production quality must match your approved sample.</p>

								<p>Our quality control staff will ensure your production goods equal your sample by comparing and testing them.</p>

								<p>We always have samples sent to our Shanghai office before sending them to you. Getting a genuine sample from a production run is one of the biggest problems we face because as many factories will specifically hand craft a sample or even worse buy it from somewhere else.</p>

								<p>Five important rules to consider when buying from China:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Never ever trust a factory when they say they have their own quality control staff.</li>
									<li>Usually if a factory thinks they can get away with something, then they will try. A factory should be more than aware that you will inspect them and follow through should any problems arise. They must be aware of your on-the-ground presence.</li>
									<li>If a sample is approved you must hold the factory responsible to the quality standards of the sample.</li>
									<li>If you make frequent visits to a factory the better your product will be.</li>
									<li>Never ship until you have approved your order. You should ignore how good your relationship with the factory is or how many previous orders you have placed.
								Never take the risk with any order, be resilient and always follow through until it’s approved.</li>

						      <div class="panel-body">
						        <h4>Why do I need a Sales Contract?</h4>
								<p>We have learned that always being prepared is a must and that's why a sales contract is vital. After all your success is our business. If for instance you have had a sample made you must document all your product specifications within a contract.</p>

								<p>You should therefore work closely with your personal Account Manager ensuring you have covered this within your contract. And it’s crucial to do this before placing any order. If there is a problem with your order, getting a factory to take responsibility is impossible without a sales contract being set in place.</p>

								<p>A well written contract equips you with bargaining power, which you can refer to continuously.</p>

								<p>Be aware that your supplier could make a terrible mistake with your product. For instance putting a Chinese plug on a product intended for the UK market. If you forgot to specify this in your contract, then they will not accept this as their fault and deflect the blame on you.</p>

								<p>A well written sales contract that includes a detailed recording of your product terms will eradicate any problems.</p>

								<h4>Here are five important considerations:</h4>
								<ol>
									<li>Verbal agreements from a factory sales representative are never enough. You must get a written, officially stamped document from the factories senior staff (management or better still the factory owner) that clearly states what both parties agree to.</li>
									<li>Always have any contractual agreements signed and stamped by senior managerial staff or the owner. Never have a sales representative do this. It must be someone with a position of authority. Don’t be fooled by a factories English speaking staff. They are there for international communication purposes and have absolutely no influence within the factory.</li>
									<li>Any payments to the factory must be fixed into passing the quality control standards that have been set. These quality specifics must be stipulated in a sales contract, which has been signed and stamped by senior management.</li>
									<li>Once a sales contract has been agreed, signed and stamped by all relevant parties, it should never be changed. This just says to the factory that you are willing to accept lower quality and that’s a downward spiral.</li>
									<li>A well written contract is a must. It gives you bargaining power and holds the factory liable to the standards you have set.</li>

									It depends on the manufacturer and the type of product. In most cases you don’t have to order a full container load.
								</p>
								<p>
									Most manufacturers are interested in filling containers with full loads and at cheaper prices. When they are dealing with smaller quantities they will increase the product price slightly per unit.

									AGSS offers a mixed container service to cater for smaller traders. You can make great savings on shipping costs using this service.
